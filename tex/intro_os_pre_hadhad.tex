\caption{ The distributions of leading $\tau$ $\pt$ in the $t_h\thadhad$-2j (a) and $t_h\thadhad$-3j (b) SR before the fake estimation. Data is more than the MC prediction because the fake tau backgrounds are not yet added due to the fakes from both $\bar{t}t$ and QCD, this part will be estimated using fake factor method which is stated in the background chapter. Only
statistical uncertainties are being shown. Underflow and overflow bins are included respectively in the first and last bins.Empty data bins here are always blinded based on our strategy.}
